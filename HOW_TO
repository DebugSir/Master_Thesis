From start to finish, for the standard way of doing the algorithm:

- Create a dataset from createToyDatasetPara.m and createToyDataset2Para.m
- Put the matrix in the same directory as the Python files
- Run PCNN.py
- New dataset: Gather the coefficient of A and B like in indices_patch.m
- Run select_patch.m
- Run BCNN.py
- Run BCNNpredict.py

At this point the classification score appears, if one wants to see the selection of the most discriminative patches:
- Prediction: Gather the coefficient like in indices_pred.m
- Run select_predictions.m
